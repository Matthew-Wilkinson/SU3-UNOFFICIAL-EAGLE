File description:
Star kinematic profiles. 
Profiles for number of star particles, mass of stars, mean(v_R), mean(v_phi), std(v_R), std(v_phi), std(v_z), kappa_co, kappa_rot, z_half, and jz/jc(E) 
for both linear and log bins and stellar <R_1/2, <2R_1/2, <R_1/4, <R_3/4.
Also has triaxial a,b,c and all galaxy ids.
